## Usage

See the [instructions for use](usage)

## Customize the Markdown export

If you know the  _Python_  programming language, you easily 
can make your own converter. The zipfile includes a template for 
modification. The script  *my_yw2md.pyw* uses the original script 
as a library and defines easy-to-adapt subclasses for Markdown conversion.
